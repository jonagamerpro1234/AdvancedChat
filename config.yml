# |Filter Chat|
# |here you can filter the unwanted words on your server and have a little more control over the chat
# 
# [!] The chat filter function is in development at a may contain error or problems
#
# [Use-Custom-Msg] will use a custom message found in the [Message] section instead of using [Form Of Censorship] [Default | false]
# [Message] here you can define a personalized message that will be sent to the player
# [Form-Of-Censorship] this is the format that the word will be censored, for example [noob = ****] this will depend on the number of characters that the word has
# [Delay] It is the waiting time that the message will have before it is sent so that spam does not form in the player's chat [Defalt | 100 ]
#
# |The format is very simple, you just have to add the word you want to censor to the list

#    - 'noob'
#    - 'stupid'
#    - '<word>'
